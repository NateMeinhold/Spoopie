# Eldorado

Gaily bedight,
A gallant knight,
In sunshine and in _shadow_,
Had journeyed long,
Singing a song,
In search of **Eldorado**.


But he grew old,
This knight so bold,
And o'er his heart a _shadow_
Fell as he found
No spot of ground
That looked like **Eldorado**.

And, as his strength
Failed him at length,
He met a pilgrim _shadow_,
"Shadow," said he,
"Where can it be,
This land of **Eldorado**?"

"Over the Mountains
Of the Moon,
Down the Valley of the _Shadow_,
Ride, boldly ride,"
The shade replied,
"If you seek for **Eldorado**!"
