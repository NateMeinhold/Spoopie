# Eldorado

<p> 
Gaily bedight,<br>
A gallant knight,<br>
In sunshine and in **shadow**, <br>
Had journeyed long,<br>
Singing a song,<br>
In search of **Eldorado**. <br> 
</p><br>


<p>
But he grew old,

This knight so bold,

And o'er his heart a _shadow_

Fell as he found

No spot of ground

That looked like **Eldorado**.
</p>


And, as his strength

Failed him at length,

He met a pilgrim _shadow_,

"Shadow," said he,

"Where can it be,

This land of **Eldorado**?"



"Over the Mountains

Of the Moon,

Down the Valley of the _Shadow_,

Ride, boldly ride,"

The shade replied,

"If you seek for **Eldorado**!"
