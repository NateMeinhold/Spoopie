# Eldorado

Gaily bedight,<br>
A gallant knight,<br>
In sunshine and in _shadow_, <br>
Had journeyed long,<br>
Singing a song,<br>
In search of **Eldorado**. <br> 
<br>

But he grew old,<br>
This knight so bold,<br>
And o'er his heart a _shadow_<br>
Fell as he found<br>
No spot of ground<br>
That looked like **Eldorado**.<br>
<br>


And, as his strength

Failed him at length,

He met a pilgrim _shadow_,

"Shadow," said he,

"Where can it be,

This land of **Eldorado**?"



"Over the Mountains

Of the Moon,

Down the Valley of the _Shadow_,

Ride, boldly ride,"

The shade replied,

"If you seek for **Eldorado**!"
