# Eldorado

Gaily bedight,<br>
A gallant knight,<br>
In sunshine and in _shadow_, <br>
Had journeyed long,<br>
Singing a song,<br>
In search of **Eldorado**. <br> 

But he grew old,<br>
This knight so bold,<br>
And o'er his heart a _shadow_<br>
Fell as he found<br>
No spot of ground<br>
That looked like **Eldorado**.<br>

And, as his strength <br>
Failed him at length, <br>
He met a pilgrim _shadow_,<br>
"Shadow," said he, <br>
"Where can it be, <br>
This land of **Eldorado**?" <br>

"Over the Mountains <br>
Of the Moon, <br>
Down the Valley of the _Shadow_, <br>
Ride, boldly ride," <br>
The shade replied, <br>
"If you seek for **Eldorado**!"<br>
<br>
